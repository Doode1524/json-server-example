- Your code should be as DRY as possible (Dont Repeat Yourself)
- Be consistent after choosing your design pattern
    - That being said, this project will be small enough where I would suggest using Functional programming
    - If you prefer to practice object-oriented programming, it is okay
    - It is most important to be consistent with your code after you choose
- Deliver an MVP project (Minimum Viable Product)
    - Ugly is good, in fact suggested. Little to no styling is expected

    - By building MVP with the above requirements, you will display your proficiency in:
        - DOM manipulation
        - Asyncronous JavaScript

        - Modern JS syntax and design patterns
